# YuGiOh Dice Probabilities

Card / dice game introduced here: https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/8ifec8/cp18_number_67/?ref=share&ref_source=link

## Rules

You and your opponent are each given two rolls. The numbers from each roll will be added together. You win the game if you have fewer points than your opponent.

As an advantage, you get to change the number from one of your opponent's rolls to 7. Ideally you'd choose the lower number since that would make a bigger difference and give you a greater chance of winning.

Example game: you roll a 4 and a 5, which gives you a total of 9. Your opponent rolls a 1 and a 5. Now you can take the lower number 1 and change that into a 7. This gives your opponent a total of 12, which means that you win the game.
